## X-URL-Uploader ( SPLIT Files more than 2GB into pieces)
---

Telegram RoBot to Upload Links. 

**Features**:

It is a fork of X-Gorn Uploader that split file that is more than 2GB into pieces and then upload those files to Telegram.

I am not a programmer and i changed code for my project. so i crippled the code to handle every video,audio,file as "File" wihtout thumbnail.
if you want to have original X-Gorn features, change it your own.
